# **NeoScan: Advancing Birth Defect Detection with Deep Learning**

## **Project Overview**

### **Story**
Birth defects represent a significant global health challenge, affecting millions of newborns annually. Early detection and intervention are crucial in managing and potentially mitigating the effects of these conditions. Traditional diagnostic methods, while effective, often require highly skilled professionals and can be resource-intensive. With the rise of artificial intelligence and deep learning, there exists an opportunity to revolutionize the way birth defects are detected, making the process faster, more accurate, and accessible to a broader range of healthcare providers.

**NeoScan** was born out of this vision. The project leverages the power of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to detect birth defects from medical images. By utilizing advanced techniques in data augmentation, batch normalization, and optimized activation functions, NeoScan aims to create a robust and reliable model that can assist healthcare professionals in making early and accurate diagnoses.
